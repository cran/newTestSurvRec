Description: Implements the routines to compare the survival curves with recurrent events, including the estimations of survival curves. The first model is a  model for recurrent event, when the data are correlated or not  correlated. It was proposed by Wang and Chang (1999) <doi:10.2307/2669690>. In the independent case, the survival function can be  estimated by the generalization of the limit product model of Pena (2001) <doi:10.1198/016214501753381922>.
